## üí° How It Works

### Expense Splitting Logic
1. **Total Pool**: All members' expenses are combined
2. **Meal-Based Division**: Costs are split based on meal consumption
3. **Fair Distribution**: Cost per meal = Total Expenses √∑ Total Meals
4. **Individual Calculation**: Each member pays (Their Meals √ó Cost per Meal)
5. **Balance Calculation**: Member Balance = Their Expenses - Their Meal Cost

### Example Calculation
```
Member A: Spent ‡ß≥2000, Ate 20 meals
Member B: Spent ‡ß≥1000, Ate 30 meals
Member C: Spent ‡ß≥500, Ate 10 meals

Total Expenses: ‡ß≥3500
Total Meals: 60
Cost per Meal: ‡ß≥3500 √∑ 60 = ‡ß≥58.33

Member A: ‡ß≥2000 - (20 √ó ‡ß≥58.33) = +‡ß≥833.40 (Credit)
Member B: ‡ß≥1000 - (30 √ó ‡ß≥58.33) = -‡ß≥750.00 (Owes)
Member C: ‡ß≥500 - (10 √ó ‡ß≥58.33) = -‡ß≥83.30 (Owes)
```
